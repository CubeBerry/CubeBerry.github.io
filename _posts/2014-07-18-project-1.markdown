description: CubeEngine is a rendering engine written in C++, developed as a personal hobby project and for portfolio purposes. This engine utilizes an integrated renderer based on both OpenGL and Vulkan. The primary objective of this project is to implement features learned from college courses, particularly those focused on OpenGL graphics. Furthermore, the project aims to adapt and apply these OpenGL-based techniques to Vulkan, thereby gaining proficiency in both graphics APIs.
